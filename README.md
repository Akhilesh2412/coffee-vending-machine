# Coffee Vending Machine
Here I have implemented a coffee vending machine
Technologies used:
- Java 8
- Springboot framework

## How do I run it?
From the root directory you can issue maven install command
> mvn clean install

This will download required dependencies and generate a file **transaction-manager.jar** in **target** directory. 
We can then simply run it using
> java -jar target/coffeemachine-1.0.jar
